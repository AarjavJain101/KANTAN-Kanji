# KANTAN-Kanji
My first version of a Kanji reviewing application inspired by my own Japanese learning.

To use the program:
-Choose a level to review Kanji from (as the level number increases the difficulty, although subjectively, also increases).
-Type in the English Reading
-Rinse and repeat until you get the Kanji correct
-If you want to restart then re-run the program.
